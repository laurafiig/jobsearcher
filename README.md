# jobsearcher

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a website which will help a job seeker to keep track of job applications and the status of each one, as well as collect data on the job search process. Users will be able to store data on their ongoing applications and submit short narratives about their job search. Administrators may view these narratives in order to collect data on the current job market.
